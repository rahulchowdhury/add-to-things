# Add to Things
![Things logo](https://github.com/rahulchowdhury/add-to-things/blob/master/things-logo.png)
A tiny companion app on Android for adding tasks to Things, since Things is Apple ecosystem only.

# How to build?
You can clone this project and build it with your personalised Things email address.

## Get a Mailgun API key
The first step is to get your own [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) API key. This will be used for sending emails to your personalised Things email (for adding tasks).

## Create local properties file
The next step is creating a local properties file at the root of this project, called `appconfig.properties` with the following content:

```
FROM_ADDRESS = "your mailgun verified email address here"
TO_ADDRESS = "your personal @things.email address here"
MAILGUN_API_KEY = "your mailgun API key here"
MAILGUN_DOMAIN = "your mailgun domain name here"
```

# Build and enjoy
Just build and run on your device and enjoy adding tasks to your Things inbox.
